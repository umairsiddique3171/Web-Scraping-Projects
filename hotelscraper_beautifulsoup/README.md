# hotelscraper_beautifulsoup
This repository has the code I used for my third web scraping project. Here I tried to do a job (posted on upwork.com) , which required scraping popular netherland hotels with their name,address and facilities.It's easy to understand and perfect for beginners learning web scraping.
